## Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project.  Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing?  Feel free to number or bullet point things here)


## Getting Started

1. Raw Data is being kept [2.Prepared Data/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

    
3. Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)
4. etc...

*If your project is well underway and setup is fairly complicated (ie. requires installation of many packages) create another "setup.md" file and link to it here*  

5. Follow setup [instructions](Link to file)

Inludes
1. Eda
2. Future engineering
3. Future Selection
4. Model Development and selecton using different regression algorithms

   * Multiple linear regression
   * Random Forest regression
   * Tree Regression
   *  SVR

   Penalized algorithms:
   * Lasso Regression
   * Ridge
   * Elastic net
   
5. Boosting is applied to some algorithms

Final result:

Random Forest has selected for future devolepment

<br>base model has an accuracy of 87.3 %
<br> tuned model imporved accuracy to 88.3 %

Improvement of 1.13%. after boosting
