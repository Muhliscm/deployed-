This project is implemented using the "Housing price dataset - Advanced regression"  from Kaggle

Inludes
1. Eda
2. Future engineering
3. Future Selection
4. Model Development and selecton using different regression algorithms

   * Multiple linear regression
   * Random Forest regression
   * Tree Regression
   *  SVR

   Penalized algorithms:
   * Lasso Regression
   * Ridge
   * Elastic net
   
5. Boosting is applied to some algorithms

Final result:

Random Forest has selected for future devolepment

<br>base model has an accuracy of 87.3 %
<br> tuned model imporved accuracy to 88.3 %

Improvement of 1.13%. after boosting
